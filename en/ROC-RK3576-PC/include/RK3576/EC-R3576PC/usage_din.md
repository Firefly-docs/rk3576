# DIN

EC-R3576PC supports an optocoupler isolation input, where IN corresponds to INPUT1 in the hardware schematic diagram and G corresponds to INPUT_COM in the hardware schematic diagram.

### Detect
The `INPUT1` in the schematic corresponds to the `IN` for silk screen printing, and the `INPUT_COM` corresponds to `G`. When `INPUT1(IN)` and INPUT_COM(G) are conducting, `GPIO3_C0_INPUT` will detect a low level; When `INPUT1(IN)` and INPUT_COM(G) are disconnected, `GPIO3_C0_INPUT` will detect a high level.

* Example 1: If 'Input (IN)' is connected to 5V, then it is to detect the input status of 'Input-COM (G)'. When 'Input-COM (G)' is low, the main control detects that 'GPIO3_C0-INPUT' is low;

*Example 2: If you want to connect to 24V, you need to connect a resistor (with a resistance value between 3.9K and 4.7K) before connecting to 'Input (IN)' to prevent burning out the optocoupler isolation chip. The logic is consistent with Example 1;

<font color=#FF0000>Note: It is strongly recommended to use the solution of Example 1. If you have other configuration ideas, please configure 'Input (IN)' and 'Input-COM (G)' according to the actual circuit schematic to prevent burning the optocoupler</font>

The Detect mode is as follows：
```
# get GPIO export
echo 112 > /sys/class/gpio/export
# set direction to input
echo in > /sys/class/gpio/gpio112/direction
# read value
cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio112/value
```
